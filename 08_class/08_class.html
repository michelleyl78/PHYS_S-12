  <h1> Class 8: Electronic Output Devices</h1>
  <h4> July 16, 2020 </h4>

  <h5> Assignment: Choose an output device that you have not used before. Program a microcontroller to operate it.</h5>
  <hr>
  <p> Since I am building an alarm clock for my final project, I wanted to use the buzzer more to create songs. However, since I already used the buzzer last week with my theremin, I decided to try to add an LED strip to light up in conjunction with notes played by the buzzer. This will be very useful for my final project since I will also have to coordinate lights and sound for my alarm clock. As someone who has never done any programming except in HTML, CSS, and Scratch, I had to learn a lot this week about coding in Arduino to achieve my goal. Before I detail the process, here's the video of my buzzer and lights playing the Flea Waltz twice through with the second time being 20 bpm faster:  </p>
  <iframe style="width:90%; height:400px" src="flea_waltz.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p> I set up my circuit with the buzzer connected to pin 6 with a 1K resistor. Then I connected the DIN pad on the LED strip to pin 11 through a 1K resistor. Here's a picture of the circuit: </p>
  <p><img src="circuit.jpg" style="width:90%" alt="(My Light Inspiration)"></p>
  <p> I started off trying to get the buzzer to play a song before I dealt with the LED strip. Since I didn't want to deal with compound time signatures or weird note durations, I chose to create the melody for the Flea Waltz, and I found easy sheet music to reference <a href="https://imslp.simssa.ca/files/imglnks/usimg/a/a6/IMSLP237418-WIMA.5f35-Floh-Walzer_Ges-Dur.pdf">here on imslp.</a></p>
  <p>I chose to modify pre-existing code that others had created for other songs. Specifically, I took a look at <a href="https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs/blob/master/takeonme/takeonme.ino">this </a>code that robsoncouto created to play Take On Me by a-ha. Instead of having to read a frequency chart and define all the notes that I needed, I was able to use this code to speed-up the process since it already defined the frequencies for notes. My music had flats, which were not defined as variables in the code, so I had to find the enharmonic equivalents for each note with a flat (i.e. Eb4 was equivalent to D#4)</p>
  <p> The code used an array called melody and accessed it in a for loop. The notes of the melody were followed by note durations and called-on separately in the loop of the sketch. Since I've never used arrays before, it took me some time to figure out how it worked. Eventually, I figured out how to change the existing notes and note durations to play Flea Waltz. </p>
  <p> However, after successfully playing one iteration of the Flea Waltz, I wanted to be able to repeat the song and increase the tempo each time since the actual piece is often played in this way. To do this, instead of having the code that played each note on the buzzer in void setup, I moved the code to void loop and wrote a line to increase the tempo by 20 after the for loop finished playing through the melody array. </p>
  <p> Although my melody was working, I still did not really understand how my code worked, specifically the for loop. However, eventually I finally figured out that the for loop was initializing thisNote and reading the actual note names of my melody array by adding 2 to thisNote to skip over the note durations in the array until thisNote < notes. The variable notes was initialized by finding sizeof(melody) / sizeof(melody[0]), which I discovered meant that the sketch was determining the number of bytes in the array to determine how long my melody was so that the for loop would stop once it reached the end of the melody. Inside the for loop, divider = melody[thisNote+1] calculated the duration of each note by reading the numerical values in between each note name (hence the +1 to read the note duration value right after whatever note name was played on the buzzer). Then, noteDuration = (wholenote) / divider and noteDuration was used in the tone function and multiplied by 0.9 for each note. </p>
  <p> However, I still didn't have lights! My ultimate goal was to set different lights to each note when played like this: </p>
  <p><img src="inspiration.gif" style="width:90%" alt="(My Light Inspiration)"></p>
  <p>Luckily, after figuring out how the array was called upon and what role the variable thisNote played in the for loop, I was able to modify my existing array to add values for which LED on the LED strip to light-up. </p>
  <p> I defined variables for each NeoPixel so that I wouldn't confuse the NeoPixel numbers for the note duration numbers. Then, I initialized LED_number as 0 and then set it equal to melody[thisNote+2] like the divider variable. Then I modified the for loop's operation to be +3 instead of +2 so that each note name would be every third item in the array. Thus, my new array had each note name followed by the note duration and then the NeoPixel to light-up. Like the buzzer's delay before the next note, I had to clear the NeoPixels at the end of the for loop. </p>
  <p> I randomly assigned NeoPixels to each different note, and luckily there were only 10 distinct notes used in the song, which corresponded perfectly to the 10 NeoPixels on the LED strip! Here's a little chart that I made: </p>
  <p><img src="chart.jpg" style="width:90%" alt="(My Light Inspiration)"></p>
  <p> My sketch worked how I wanted it to, but I was still unsatisfied since the NeoPixels were lighting up, but only in one color. Thus, I had to go back to modifying the array, but unlike before, I had to figure out a way to refer to a group of three numbers representing a particular RGB color instead of only one integer. I couldn't just use #define like before.</p>
  <p> After looking at <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Complete-NeoPixel-Guide/">this NeoPixel guide </a>, I was able to use uint32_t to designate a variable for the RGB color value converted into a 32-bit color value. I could now call on the specific colors I wanted in the melody array. Instead of adding 3 to thisNote, I now added 4 and set a new variables called LED_color which I could call on in strip.setPixelColor. One note now had 4 attributes, and it looked like this: </p>
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
NOTE_DS4, 8, PIX_1, red, 
// represents D#4 played for the duration of an eighth note, lighting up NeoPixel 2 (since they are counted started from 0) in the color red
