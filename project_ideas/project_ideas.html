		<h3> Idea 1: Simon Says Alarm Clock </h3>
			<p> I have a bit of trouble waking up in the mornings (to the point where I usually have to set several alarms five minutes apart to even wake up). I was thinking of designing an alarm clock that would work like those old Hasbro Simon Says games, forcing me to use my memory to turn off the alarm sound. It could use 4 different color LED lights that could light up in a specific pattern with specific sounds, and I would have to repeat the pattern to turn off the alarm. 
		<h3> Idea 2: Music Glove </h3>
			<p> A while ago, I remember looking up piano-themed accessories on Amazon since I was a piano enthusiast. I remember coming up with scarfs, t-shirts, and ties, but there was one tie which looked like a piano and could play specific notes if you pressed the right keys. There are 12 different notes in an octave, so I wonder if I could create a glove which would play a different pitch when each finger is pressed, and two additional notes could be played by tapping one's palm against the table. <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/midi-drum-glove">I found this cool drum glove which looks like it would be made very similarly.</a></p>
