	<h1> Class 1: GitHub and Website Development</h1>
	<p> Since I've had a little bit of experience in HTML/CSS from Computers class in Middle School, the learning curve in creating my website wasn't so steep; however, I did have to reacquaint myself with the basics via W3 Schools. I copied some of the code from W3 Schools to create a navigation bar at the top of each page, although I changed some of the styling and colors in CSS. </p>
  <p> My biggest struggle was figuring out how to specify file paths. Maybe I didn't have as many folders when I had previously done HTML, which is why file path notation seemed to be so new to me. Eventually, I figured out how to use relative file paths with / for files located at the root of the current web, ./ for files located in folders located in the current folder, and ../ for files located in folders one level above the current folder. I had to edit the navigation bar file paths depending on the page, but I'm glad to have finally figured this out!</p>

  <p> This is how my website's homepage currently looks with some broken links for documentation of the next few classes, but I hope to improve the layout throughout the course as I get better at HTML/CSS.</p>
  <p> This is also my first time using GitHub, so I was a bit confused at first about repositories and pushing, but through some trial and error, I've figured it out!
