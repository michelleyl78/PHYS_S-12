  <h5> Assignment: Create a website and make a page with a proposal for a possible final project. Include an index.html page with links to each assignment page, an about page, and some customization using HTML and CSS </h5>

	<p> Since I've had a little bit of experience in HTML/CSS from Computers class in Middle School, the learning curve in creating my website wasn't so steep; however, I did have to reacquaint myself with the basics via W3 Schools. I copied some of the code from W3 Schools to create a navigation bar at the top of each page, although I changed some of the styling and colors in CSS. I also found some code for gradient buttons on codepen.io, although I had to edit them to span the entire width of the page. By playing with the CSS code for both of these templates, I feel like I really learned a lot. </p>
  <p> My biggest struggle was figuring out how to specify file paths. Maybe I didn't have as many folders when I had previously done HTML, which is why file path notation seemed to be so new to me. Eventually, I figured out how to use relative file paths with / for files located at the root of the current web, ./ for files located in folders located in the current folder, and ../ for files located in folders one level above the current folder. I had to edit the navigation bar file paths depending on the page, but I'm glad to have finally figured this out! Here's the html for my index page!</p>
  <p><img src="html.PNG" style="width:100%" alt="HTML"></p>
  <p> This is how my website's homepage currently looks with some broken links for documentation of the next few classes, but I hope to improve the layout throughout the course as I get better at HTML/CSS.</p>

  <p> This is also my first time using GitHub, so I was a bit confused at first about repositories and pushing, but through some trial and error, I've figured it out! </p>
